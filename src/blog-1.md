the function uses forEach to loop over every elements in the array. the forEach methods takes a callback that is excuted once for each element of the array.

example:
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
first element 1 sum =0+1=1
second element 2 sum= 1+2=3
third element 3 sum 3+3=6
fourth elemnt 4 sum = 6+4=10
fith element 5 sum = 10+5 =15
so the output will be 15;
